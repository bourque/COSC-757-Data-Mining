Use:
    This program is intended to be executed via the command line as
    such:
        >>> python master_column_analysis.py

Outputs:
    (1) results.dat - A text file containing the classification
        results.  The file contains four columns: (1) The row/pixel
        number, (2) the pixel class, (3) The classificaiton date (in
        MJD) and (4) The index of the classification date.
    (2) histogram_<row_num>.png - A histogram showing the distribution
        of pixel values for the given row/pixel and where the values
        fall within the outlier/warm/hot regimes.
    (3) scatter_<row_num>.png - A scatter plot showing the pixel values
        over time for the given row/pixel and where the values fall
        within the warm/hot regimes.
    (4) An output to the STDOUT showing the number of pixel for each
        pixel class.

    Perform the algorithm to classify the given pixel.  There are 4
    classes of pixels:

    0 = Good
    1 = Warm & Stable
    2 = Hot & Stable
    3 = Unstable

    Good pixels are defined as pixels whose values remain stable and
    are not deemed a consistent outlier throughout their lifetimes.
    Warm pixels are those whose values are outliers but remain below
    the hot pixel threshold throughout their lifetimes.  Hot pixels are
    those whose values consistently exceed the hot pixel threshold
    throughout their lifetimes.  Stable pixels are those whose values
    remain relatively constant throughout their lifetimes, regardless
    if they fall within the "good", "warm", or "hot" regime.  Unstable
    pixels are those whose values vary beyond the variance threshold
    for a significant portion of their lifetimes.

    Parameters:
        pixel : numpy array
            A 1D array corresponding to a row in the master column
            image.
        row_num : int

        dark_current : float

            column image.
        stdev : float
            The standard deviation of the background associated with
            the master column image.
        hot_thresh : float
            The threshold the defines a hot pixel (i.e. if a pixel's
            value exceeds this, it is deemed as "hot")
        sig : float
            The number of standard deviations beyond which a pixel

    Convert the data from DN to e-/s and remove postflash level.

    The data in its raw form is in units of DN (data number) which is
    essentially a measure of the number of counts the pixel received
    during the observation.  However, it is easier to consider the
    pixels in units of electrons per second.

    Some observations are taken with "postflash", which is an
    additional uniform background signal (of usually 12 e-) that is
    introduced to the pixels at the time of observation.  In order to
    compare pixel values across postflash and non-postflash
    observations, the postflash signal is removed from those columns
    that correspond to observations that have postflash.  The existance
    of postflash is indicated by the FLASHLVL metadata keyword, which
    stores the number of e- introduced by the postflash.  If the
    FLASHLVL is 0, then no postflash occured.

        data : numpy array
